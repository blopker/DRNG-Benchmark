Deterministic Random Number Generator Benchmarks
====================

Abstract
--------
Deterministic Random Number Generators (DRNGs) are important for a wide variety of applications. However, some DRNGs are less cryptographically secure than others. Typically the more cryptography a RNG provides the slower it is. This paper explores various ways of generating random numbers and analyses application performance requirements to see if insecure DRNGs can be discarded in practice.
